(working title)

This is a demo application for a finance project I'm working on with a team in Melbourne, Australia. The objective of this project is to show how making small changes in your spending habits can reap big rewards in the long run. Might turn it into a business one day if the scope allows. For now, it's open-source and just for us to learn Swift to better serve our other open-source commitments.
